A WordPress plugin to register media selection meta boxes.

== Description ==

With the release of WordPress 3.5, an effort was made to decouple attachments from the posts where they were uploaded, which was a shift from previous versions, and a greater emphasis was placed on the `[gallery]` shortcode. Backward compatibility was maintained, but it became a little less intuitive to manage a gallery of images that were simply attached to a post. In any case it has always been a little difficult to select multiple featured images, or multiple galleries, for use in different areas in a template.

Metamedia allows for registering simple meta boxes like the "Featured Image" meta box for selecting a single image or gallery of images to be stored in a post meta field for easy retrieval and usage in templates. It can be used with any post type and uses the native media frame.

*This plugin doesn't do anything on its own. You should only install it to enable support for functionality defined in your theme or if you're a developer and want to leverage the benefits it provides.*
